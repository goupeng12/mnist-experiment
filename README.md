# mnist-experiment
  new to neroral network, new to tensorflow, I try some experiments based on MNIST dataset.

  under the instruction of jikexueyuan.com (url at http://wiki.jikexueyuan.com/project/tensorflow-zh/tutorials/mnist_beginners.html), I try its code to train model after setting the environment of tensorflow and python

  what I do in the experiment is :
experiment zero :try to use tensorboard to show the procedure of the convergence of accuracy and loss.
experiment one : to add a new hidden lay to experiment zero.
experiment two : try to save the model I train and reload the model existed. 
experiment three : to change the activate-function
experiment four : to change the loss-function
experiment five : redo experiment zero using cnn
experiment six : redo experiment one using cnn
experiment seven : redo experiment two using cnn
experiment eight : redo experiment three using cnn
experiment nine : redo experiment four using cnn
